Only supports Debian/Ubuntu based distributions, i'll add more later. Also, The code handles errors pretty badly, so you might have to double-check everything. 
Im planing on making it scan the errors and tell the user why the install didn't work because right now, if an error occurs, it will just keep going and act like nothing happened.
